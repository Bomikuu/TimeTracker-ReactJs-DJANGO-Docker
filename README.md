# Time Tracker Django & React application

This is a set up so that we can easily create apps that use Django on the backend (and take advantage of the amazing admin UI) and React (set up with [`create-react-app`](https://npm.im/create-react-app)) for the front end application.

## How to Run

1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`
1. There should now be two servers running:
  - [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) is the Django app
  - [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) is the React app
